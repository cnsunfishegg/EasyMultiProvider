# Changelog

## 0.12.11 (2026-10-05)

- Gate HTTP, SSE and WebSocket calls on evidence for the selected source and
  model. Confirmed exhaustion and explicit rate-limit cooldowns affect the next
  attempt immediately; unknown or low quota stays usable. Recovery permits one
  same-source probe and never selects another account automatically.
- Merge concurrent quota refreshes by account owner, reject stale results after
  credential changes or newer failures, bound helper concurrency and failure
  backoff, and wake the existing sampler for stale request-time observations.
- Preserve `plugins = false` in quota helpers, isolate their home directories,
  cap output, and bound shutdown when a helper ignores EOF. Cancel quota reads
  on exit while still saving rotated credentials, and record worker drain stages.
- Share credential import and local catalog publication behind existing APIs,
  with idempotent imports and receipts that distinguish local publication from
  verified Codex use. Existing integration leases and actions are preserved.
- Stop automatic replay after ambiguous native connection failures and gateway
  timeouts. Add real Codex/EMP fixture acceptance for explicit model switching
  and continuation after quota rejection or interruption.
- Build release updaters against the publishing repository, so fork packages
  continue receiving that fork's releases. See `docs/backend-availability.md`
  for acceptance evidence and remaining verification limits.

## 0.12.10 (2026-10-04)

- Reduce request and stream teardown delays by starting disconnect monitoring
  only when needed and waking its worker immediately when a request ends.
  Preserve cancellation, unread socket data and the previous socket timeout.
- Reduce SSE serialization and request-size accounting allocations with a shared
  JSON writer. Add optional local profiling; normal builds keep it disabled.
- Unify request preparation and external HTTP/SSE/WebSocket retry handling while
  preserving protocol fallback, retry limits, native response fields and
  conversation behavior.
- Preserve pending rotated credentials when account reimport or removal cannot
  be committed. Configuration, credential files and published state retain their
  transaction and rollback boundaries.
- Separate configuration, catalog, request outcomes and management notifications
  into focused modules. Reuse catalog inputs within each operation without
  introducing a stale response cache.
- Split the management page's client, settings, request details, diagnostics and
  styles into embedded assets. Ignore late diagnostic responses after closing
  the dialog; retain the existing appearance and controls.

## 0.12.9 (2026-10-02)

- Match account Credit and reset-count numbers to the 12px quota percentages,
  preventing account-title styles from enlarging them.

## 0.12.8 (2026-10-01)

- Combine account identity, subscription plan, Credit and reset count into one
  compact summary. Open account details to view recorded model/token usage and
  API-equivalent cost, save an alias, choose a reset or remove an imported account.
  Keep Edit, Refresh and Trend aligned across all account rows.
- Group automatic activation, external-model Codex web search and automatic-review
  account fallback in Settings. Enable all three by default, retain saved opt-outs
  and fix sliding-switch track height and circle alignment at different browser zoom levels.
- Use eye buttons to show or hide models, matching the rest of the management UI.
- Open recent request details from account, Provider and model activity dots.
  Show the selected model, actual target, upstream-declared model, duration,
  dispatch count and retry timeline through the existing event stream.
  Keep conversations and credentials out of these bounded in-memory receipts.
- Retry temporary release-check and download failures up to three additional
  times. Display retry progress and specific failure stages with relevant recovery
  steps. Restart partial downloads from zero and retain size/checksum validation;
  do not retry installation, permission or checksum failures.

## 0.12.7 (2026-09-30)

- Keep known subscription models routable when a refreshed catalog omits them,
  so existing conversations do not fail with a local unknown-model error.
  Isolate retained metadata by account and backend, and prefer fresh model settings.
- Fix Claude requests rejected before forwarding when Claude Code repeats its
  reasoning effort on a system reminder. Preserve the request setting and exact
  conversation checks; reject conflicting settings and unexpected fields.
- Record Claude CLI failures with their specific error code, HTTP status and
  duration, without storing conversations or credentials.
- Separate history, context preparation, protocol projection, integration and
  WebSocket handling into focused modules; remove unused core scaffolding.
- Confirm queued internal writes and expose history-scan acknowledgement and
  completion through the existing event stream. Keep scheduled quota refreshes.
- Extend content-free diagnostics for HTTP completion, routing retries,
  cancellation, worker admission and startup failures.
- Compact account identity, Credit and reset controls without hiding the main
  actions. Size shared credit amounts to the visible accounts.

## 0.12.6 (2026-09-30)

- Save the latest update failure with its stage, HTTP status or available system
  error code. Keep this small receipt after staging cleanup and across restarts,
  and show a specific failure stage in the update dialog. Updater phase receipts
  include process identity and time; startup failures record the child exit code.

- Align Credit and reset controls in a shared central account column with stable
  widths and right-aligned amounts. Place Delete before Edit, Refresh and Trend
  so their positions match for Native and imported accounts. Keep the complete
  control groups together on smaller screens.

## 0.12.5 (2026-09-30)

- Show the Codex version and model status on one line; keep detailed application
  and engine information in diagnostics. Compact the subscription model editor,
  move Credit and reset controls into account headers, and align activity dots
  before names throughout the model and account lists.
- Restore missing reasoning levels and image capabilities for known Claude models
  in CPA and local Claude connections. Existing models gain the defaults on load;
  provider restrictions and manual settings remain authoritative. Add editable
  reasoning levels to the model form and publish them to the Codex model picker.
- Animate the enabled EMP dot-matrix logo in gray and green. Make actual account,
  provider and model request activity visible with a brighter pulse and halo,
  while respecting reduced-motion settings.
- Show a red dot on Check updates when a newer release is available, with a quiet
  background check when the management page opens.
- Fix Windows update handoff waiting on an already-exited EMP whose process handle
  is still held by its launcher. Packaged update and rollback checks now start and
  exit an actual old EMP while retaining its process handle.

## 0.12.4 (2026-09-30)

- Recognize the ChatGPT App's nested macOS engine and verified Windows engine
  cache. Show App/extension and engine versions separately; check operations
  when used instead of rejecting every client below Codex 0.158. Keep existing
  model catalogs when an engine version cannot be observed.
- Support signed macOS App engines in shared Applications installations.
  Cached version reads remain responsive while runtime discovery is running.
- Report an unavailable catalog control interface as an unverified catalog,
  without claiming the App has stopped. Explain active conversation locks when
  native restoration or exit must wait, while keeping EMP running.
- Repair upgrades from older Windows releases without changing account keys or
  encrypted credentials, and write private state without requiring permission
  to change file ownership.
- Add one global preference to show or hide context labels across Native,
  Subscription and External Provider catalog routes. Old migration bundles
  without the preference preserve the destination value; the setting does not
  change model context windows.
- Automatically sync native and subscription model catalogs and capabilities
  from authenticated Codex catalog responses; retain last-good data on refresh
  failure and preserve visibility, aliases, and context overrides. Newly
  exposed models need no EMP release or manual model-list edit. In Codex 0.158,
  an already-open picker may need reloading; EMP shows its existing reload
  notice.
- Expand model search from an accessible magnifier control, with Escape to clear
  and collapse it and reduced-motion support.
- Show request activity beside models, Providers and Subscription accounts:
  active dots mark dispatched requests and their tooltips show the in-flight
  count; recent dots mark completed work. Activity comes from the authenticated
  event stream; a disconnect clears active confidence.
- Add two Claude routes through the installed Claude Code CLI: Local Claude
  subscription reuses the current OS user's Claude Code sign-in, which EMP checks
  before each request; CLI API-key and Console auth do not qualify for this mode.
  Sign in through Claude Code. CPA uses a Claude-Code-compatible Base URL and API
  key. Add local-login model aliases or full IDs manually. Direct Anthropic API
  remains a separate Anthropic API Provider.
- Forward image inputs and supported inline document content only when the
  Claude model's configured capabilities and selected upstream support them.
  Codex executes tool calls, and replies remain buffered until generation
  finishes.

## 0.12.3 (2026-09-29)

- Validate against Codex 0.158.0 and raise the minimum accepted client version
  to 0.158.0. Older clients receive an update message; newer, unvalidated
  clients are not guaranteed compatible.
- Find npm-installed Codex in known Unix nvm locations when EMP starts from a
  desktop launcher with a minimal `PATH`. Use the installation's trusted Node
  interpreter without requiring manual symlinks; preserve an existing Codex
  selection on `PATH` ahead of nvm fallback discovery.
- Discover the official VS Code extension, managed Codex daemon and ChatGPT
  desktop app runtimes on Windows, Linux, macOS Intel and Apple Silicon.
  Resolve Windows npm's native payload without depending on a desktop shell's
  Node path, and select the CLI resource instead of launching the app GUI.
- Recheck cached Codex installations when their executable is replaced,
  removed, or no longer trusted, so quota queries can select a usable runtime.
- Separate saved integration settings from the running Codex model catalog.
  A matching catalog confirms model visibility, not a provider-route change;
  absence of EMP models alone no longer claims native routing is restored.
- Keep catalog checks read-only. Previous observations cannot override a
  configuration conflict or verify a different saved target, and startup no
  longer presents an old observation as a fresh result.
- Disable remote plugin synchronization in isolated quota and reset helpers,
  avoiding repeated plugin bundle downloads when those short-lived helpers
  start. Normal Codex plugins and account isolation are preserved.
- Convert affected EMP-owned compaction checkpoints before restoring native
  settings, including supported parent, child and grandchild histories. Back up
  each affected rollout before rewriting it, recover interrupted writes, and
  refuse unsafe or unsupported changes. Finish active conversations and close
  Codex before restoring. Use **Restore Native** in the Web UI, or run
  `EMP restore` from the command line.
- Limit history repair to affected conversations, stream the initial scan,
  and bound retained data so unrelated unfinished conversations do not block
  restoration. Render the successful restore response without fetching a
  server that has already stopped.
- Handle Codex 0.158.0 numeric reasoning controls explicitly: incompatible
  external protocol projections return an error instead of silently omitting
  the requested setting.

## 0.12.2 (2026-09-28)

- Show what the running Codex actually loaded: the integration card reads
  `model/list` from Codex when Codex reaches EMP and reports "Codex is using
  EMP", "Restart" or "Codex is not running". Updates arrive over the page's
  event stream; the page no longer polls.
- Restart messages always refer to Codex; the version note appears only when
  Codex is unsupported. Add an auto-dismissing notice and an animated logo.
- Support every Codex from 0.149.0 on without a runtime selector.
- Show external models with Codex's 95% effective context window.
- Price prefixed routes, count unknown models as 0, and add pricing references.
- Clearer error messages that say whether the key, network or service failed;
  per-modality model tests; a shared quota period picker.
- The test suite is Rust-only: live Python-oracle comparisons are removed and
  the Python E2E driver is replaced by Rust user-journey tests.
- The repository is Rust-only: the Python service, its tests and tools are
  removed (they remain on the `python_archive` branch). Packaging, package
  smoke tests and release checks run with `cargo xtask`, and CI no longer
  installs Python.
- `EMP --emp-migrate-config SOURCE TARGET` copies an older configuration, its
  state and the files it references into the desktop configuration directory,
  backing up anything it replaces.
- The Linux installer no longer needs Python: it uses `curl`, `tar`, `gzip`
  and `sha256sum`, reads the newly published
  `EMP-linux-x86_64.tar.gz.sha256`, and migrates configurations with EMP.

## 0.12.1 (2026-09-25)

- Ship the Rust rewrite as the release implementation: the Python source moves
  to the `python_archive` branch and the `main` branch now builds the native
  EMP service from the Rust workspace.
- Stream Codex rollout history with bounded reconstruction instead of loading
  the whole file, and add reverse scan with Codex-style checkpoint replay for
  paginated resumes; the real 523 MB rollout answers in ~4.4 s within 223 MiB
  RSS.
- Align external 429/504 handling with OMP: honor `Retry-After` up to 300 s,
  back off exponentially (500 ms base, 8 s cap, ≤25% jitter) when absent,
  retry capacity 429s while keeping quota exhaustion terminal, and never retry
  free routes.
- Separate model reasoning from answer text in Codex output for Gemma-family
  models, matching the OMP reference event layout.
- Cancel Responses-WebSocket turns as soon as the downstream client
  disconnects, releasing native and external upstream streams immediately.


## 0.11.6 (2026-09-21)

- Normalize pasted external-provider URLs from a bare origin, `/v1`, or a
  concrete Responses/Chat Completions endpoint into the route EMP needs.
- Keep the main management and model actions visible while making provider,
  model, and subscription cards more compact and consistently aligned.
- Show subscription identity and plan as one segmented badge, place 5-hour and
  7-day quotas side by side, and mark an unreported limit with repeated slashes
  that remain visible outside the quota bar.
- Record subscription plans in quota history, show credits as compact badges,
  and expose reported reset times as both a local UTC timestamp and a remaining
  duration.
- Consume an available quota-reset credit through the official Codex app-server
  method with explicit confirmation, an idempotency key, and an immediate quota
  refresh.
- Verify against Codex 0.155.0 that a native WebSocket TLS handshake failure
  falls back once to HTTP without exposing a reconnect loop to the user.

## 0.11.5 (2026-09-21)

- Preserve reasoning as separate Codex stream items for Chat Completions models
  instead of folding it into the visible answer.
- Let users edit external model input modalities and mark image support as
  supported, unsupported, or unknown. Add an opt-in bundled-icon test; a
  successful reply is an observation and does not silently change metadata.
- Normalize duplicate `/v1` segments in external provider URLs and avoid
  forced credential rotation when reading imported subscription quota.
- Record bounded stream failure phase and retry count for diagnosis without
  storing request or response content. Existing missing-terminal handling
  still fails closed; intermittent issue #7 needs a current live reproduction.
- Rewrite the READMEs around the two main uses: one Codex model picker for
  multiple subscriptions, and external API models with a native-like workflow.

Known limitation: the repeated 503 reports in issue #11 are not yet tied to a
single cause. Local records show native WebSocket handshake failures; they do
not establish an external-provider fault.

## 0.11.4 (2026-09-18)

- Adapt model routing and runtime compatibility checks to Codex CLI 0.155.0;
  recommend 0.155.0 while retaining the existing 0.149.x minimum.
- Preserve selected native HTTP/SSE, compact and WebSocket response metadata,
  including turn state, model identity and errors. Keep catalog revision
  notifications separate from turn state and avoid stale handshake metadata
  on reused connections.
- Keep known native model aliases consistent with the requested catalog slug,
  preventing false account-risk warnings while preserving real model changes.
- Preserve native failure codes and pre-output HTTP status so permanent policy
  and invalid-prompt errors are reported without unnecessary generation retries.
- Isolate native connections and model catalogs by the selected user/workspace
  owner, and normalize credential header names before WebSocket handshakes.
- Parse streamed UTF-8 across network chunks and validate complete SSE events,
  retaining context errors and final events without a trailing blank line.
  Match Codex's malformed-event tolerance only on native Responses paths;
  external protocol validation remains strict.
- Translate configured JSON Schema output to Chat Completions and Anthropic,
  preserve supported Anthropic reasoning effort, and retain store/include/cache
  intent for the official OpenAI Responses endpoint.
- Preserve Codex's persistent-to-disabled reasoning wire alias when an external
  Responses model explicitly advertises persistent reasoning support.
- Key compaction summaries by the actual mapped history prefix and output
  budget, preventing stale cache reuse and missing history. Preserve unfinished
  client tool-search pairs and visible server-search results during translation.
- Accept valid native server-side tool-search output at stream completion,
  avoiding a false failure after successful tool execution; retain response-body
  consistency checks and strict portable output validation.
- Enable prompt downstream writes with TCP_NODELAY. Local low-concurrency
  WebSocket measurements show reduced first-token delay; no universal model
  throughput improvement is claimed.

- Recover a native WebSocket request rejected by the peer with close code 1009
  before any response event through HTTP/zstd inside EMP. Keep subsequent full
  requests on HTTP for that local connection and route, without unsafe replay
  after acceptance/output or repeated failed model responses to Codex. Record
  close-frame ordering without storing frame contents or close reasons.
- Restore GPT-5.5 in subscription lists and context editing when the upstream
  catalog exposes it; preserve user-selected hidden models instead of applying
  a premature hard-coded retirement filter.

## 0.11.3 (2026-09-17)

- Grow large request capacity in 16 MiB steps instead of doubling it. Keep
  concurrent reservations atomic and preserve 512 MiB of system headroom, so
  ordinary remote-compaction requests no longer fail at the 64 MiB boundary
  merely because the next power-of-two reservation is too large.
- Report temporary memory pressure as retryable `503
  request_capacity_unavailable`, with current memory usage, available memory
  and the required capacity. Keep actual request-size violations as `413`.
- Detect legacy Linux system installations without modifying them. Guide users
  to remove the old package and install the user-level archive; keep existing
  configuration in the user profile and remove the privileged `pkexec` update
  path.
- Validate account metadata before replacing credentials and keep credential,
  account and main-configuration writes in one rollback transaction. Derive
  duplicate-Native identity from the replacement credential during reimport.
- Store task, turn, session and parent identifiers as run-local pseudonymous
  references in diagnostics while retaining request correlation and omitting
  prompts, tool arguments and credentials.
- Stream SSE promptly on urllib3 versions that do not expose
  `HTTPResponse.read1()`, preserving connection reuse, cancellation behavior
  and bounded cleanup on Windows.
- Run the complete unit suite in runtime compatibility CI, in addition to the
  platform-specific protocol checks.

## 0.11.2 (2026-09-16)

- Set per-model context windows for Native and imported subscriptions, bounded
  by each model's subscription catalog maximum; preserve Codex's effective
  percentage and use the same context for display and request checks. Refresh
  subscription model limits with the selected account's credentials.
- Hide GPT-5.5 from subscription model lists and editing options; keep external
  providers and existing task routes unaffected.
- Install Linux archives into the current user's data directory with a command
  launcher and desktop entry; keep user configuration and avoid administrator
  authorization for updates of these installations.
- Preserve conflicting migration accounts under unique destination IDs and
  prefixes; update confirmed reimports and move their route display settings.
- Allow Base64/JSON expansion when uploading a migration while keeping the
  decoded `.emp` file limit at 32 MiB and other endpoint limits unchanged.
- Report actual export counts and warn when Native login credentials are missing.
- Group new ChatGPT usage by the selected account's opaque identity instead of
  local route IDs; retain Native/Subscription categories and leave old account
  attribution unconfirmed. Keep external usage grouped by provider source.
- Close unscoped replay iterators once on exhaustion, cancellation or failure.
- Include migration and usage regressions in runtime compatibility checks.
- Choose Native, other subscriptions and external providers when exporting
  encrypted `.emp` files. Include the selected routes, display settings and
  managed credentials only; retain the existing migration format and full-export
  default. Native includes the machine's Codex login credentials and imports them
  as an additional subscription without replacing the destination login.
- Bound incomplete HTTP SSE lines before they reach the outer parser; preserve
  complete UTF-8 lines and close oversized streams immediately.
- Authenticate HTTP proxies using proxy-only headers, including CONNECT tunnels;
  decode URL-encoded credentials and keep origin credentials and pools isolated.
- Bound native WebSocket pre-output buffering by event count and byte size,
  and send each event's existing JSON encoding without serializing it again.
- Reuse recently healthy native WebSockets without a synchronous pong round trip;
  idle connections still require a probe, and sent requests are never replayed.
- Carry the native compressed WebSocket's selected proxy into its handshake so
  connection identity and transport use the same settings during proxy switches.
- Skip signature stream parsing without a replay scope and remove redundant
  namespace-container copying while preserving tool definition isolation.
- Reject non-object quota JSON-RPC with a specific protocol error and retain
  quota failure codes in management diagnostics.
- Read Codex quota subprocess JSON-RPC as UTF-8 on every OS. Report invalid
  output and pipe read failures explicitly instead of crashing reader threads;
  drain diagnostic stderr as bytes without changing account credentials.
- Support Linux system-directory updates through the desktop's administrator
  authorization dialog. Use deb packages for deb installations, preserve the
  normal user identity on restart, and retain package-aware recovery. Report
  cancelled or unavailable authorization without stopping the existing service.
- Restrict external model metadata inheritance to reviewed coding instructions
  and tool settings; do not copy native experimental-context capabilities or
  another subscription's access-program entitlements.
- Separate Codex cache-affinity headers from history identity, handle startup
  prewarm without a turn ID, and reject stale WebSocket thread/window chains.
- Map namespaced external tools without merging same-name tools. Restore names
  in full and streamed responses; preserve call IDs, history, and tool selection.
- Support Codex client-executed tool search for external providers, including
  discovered definitions, tool execution, and subsequent history reconstruction.
  Reject conflicting definitions and unsupported server-executed searches.
- Add independent Windows/macOS/Linux runtime compatibility CI with a fixed
  official Codex binary, isolated homes, and local protocol fixtures.
- Isolate TLS verification contexts between pooled connections to avoid mutable
  Windows trust-store handshake state leaking across concurrent requests.
- Handle browser disconnects while returning management errors without a second
  response or an uncaught traceback. Distinguish quota connection failures.
- Compact completed tool batches within oversized active turns while preserving
  instructions, recent results, and pending tool calls. Send historical tool
  records as data to the summary model rather than as executable tool calls.
- Reuse verified HTTP connections for external providers and completed Responses
  streams. Preserve immediate SSE delivery, proxy selection, cancellation safety,
  and the prohibition on automatic request replay and credential redirects.
- Preserve external stream failure reasons through HTTP error translation and
  distinguish an unfinished stream from an upstream HTTP server error.
- Trace history reconstruction and summary calls by request ID, including safe
  failure causes and compaction metrics. Retain TLS/HTTP exception chains for
  request and streaming failures without logging conversation content.
- Accept standard Responses message content when extracting history summaries,
  and preserve specific history failure reasons in diagnostic observations.
- Check for a fresh release whenever Check updates is opened, while preserving
  an update already in progress. Remove the duplicate check button in the dialog.

## 0.11.1 (2026-09-13)

- Combine Enable EMP and Restore Native into one button in the same position.
  Its label and action follow the confirmed integration state.
- Disable the button while applying settings and allow retry after a failure.
  Keep the existing confirmation dialog and recovery action for conflicts.
- Remove the Check again button while retaining automatic status verification.

## 0.11.0 (2026-09-13)

- Add a persistent Usage & estimates view with local-time ranges, hourly/daily
  bars and separate Native, other Subscription and External Provider totals.
- Estimate API-equivalent USD token costs using a public price catalog refreshed
  daily. Preserve historical rates, fill missing prices when available, and
  distinguish unpriced requests from free usage.
- Retain output, reasoning, cache-write lifetimes and reported service tiers
  through response conversion; count cached and reasoning subsets only once.
- Scan local Codex session and archive history in the background, then read
  only changed files. Browse all available history without restarting Codex.
- Deduplicate repeated usage updates, copied/archived rollouts and fork replay.
  Match history with live EMP observations by turn, model and reported counts;
  warn when overlapping records cannot be matched reliably.
- Keep historical account identities separate from current logins. Show unknown
  sources and inconsistent legacy usage instead of guessing accounts or prices.
- Keep existing configuration and quota history unchanged. Usage stays local;
  historical costs use available scan-time prices and are not actual invoices.

## 0.10.2 (2026-09-12)

- Move notifications away from the header and add a dismiss button. Success
  messages close automatically; errors remain available until dismissed.
- Use a dedicated upgrade icon, distinct from data import, export and quota refresh.
- Keep transient native WebSocket TLS and gateway failures in Codex's retry
  flow instead of immediately disabling the route and replaying over HTTP.
  Preserve HTTP fallback for unsupported WebSocket upgrades.
- Count pre-fallback connection attempts separately from final request health
  and cache metrics, while retaining the failure details in diagnostic history.

## 0.10.1 (2026-09-12)

- Show upstream-reported prompt cache hit rates by model, account/provider and
  speed mode in Performance and health, with token-weighted 10-minute periods.
  Skip idle periods and distinguish missing measurements from zero cache hits.
- Preserve cache usage through Responses, Chat Completions (including DeepSeek)
  and Anthropic Messages, for streaming and non-streaming requests. Retain the
  numeric counts in diagnostic logs across restarts without storing prompt content.
- Refresh account quotas independently and share overlapping reads for the same
  account, including short-lived failure results, without repeating token refreshes.
- Notify the Web UI when background quota reads finish, preserving the open trend
  view and keeping periodic synchronization available if notifications disconnect.
- Add collapsible recent failure details with the selected service, connection,
  output progress and diagnostic ID, without displaying conversation content.
- Move data import and export into the top toolbar, group related actions and
  preferences, and keep controls aligned as the window narrows.

## 0.9.99 (2026-09-12)

- Divide quota trends by recorded reset periods, with local calendar-day divisions
  in the weekly view. Click a period to inspect it and go back without reopening the chart.
- Switch time ranges and quota windows using the loaded history, keeping the chart
  frame stable and preserving the inspected period during background refreshes.
- Show the hover guide at the nearest quota sample.

## 0.9.98 (2026-09-11)

- Fix collaboration namespace collisions when native WebSocket requests fall back
  to HTTP, including subsequent requests while WebSocket connections cool down.
- Finish Subscription edits once settings are saved; refresh the model catalog
  and Codex status in the background, reporting synchronization failures separately.
- Identify collaboration namespace errors and record content-free tool namespace
  counts and incremental-request markers for troubleshooting.

## 0.9.97 (2026-09-11)

- Notify Codex when EMP model names, visibility or available models change.
- Verify loaded display names and descriptions, not only model IDs.
- Read the existing Windows Codex control socket and discover Linux App plugin runtimes.
- Preserve safe upstream error categories and retry delays across HTTP and WebSocket responses.
- Restore recent performance records in event-time order, even when log file timestamps tie or change.
- Extend Codex compatibility through 0.154.x, with 0.154.0 recommended.

## 0.9.96 (2026-09-09)

- Remember Web UI login for 30 days across EMP restarts.
- Show a readable sign-in page when the browser session is missing or expired.
- Reject non-ASCII bootstrap and cookie values without crashing HTTP requests.

## 0.9.95 (2026-09-09)

- Add an authenticated Exit EMP action that restores native configuration before stopping.
- Relaunch Windows EMP in a visible console after updates and rollback.
- Restore owned integration settings on Windows console close and normal shutdown notifications.
- Use the verified candidate for the update worker on subsequent updates.


## 0.9.94 (2026-09-09)

- Parse coalesced SSE events before applying per-event size limits, avoiding false
  502 errors when multiple valid events arrive together.
- Preserve content-free stream parsing reasons in diagnostics and client errors,
  distinguishing invalid JSON, oversized events and unexpected terminal states.


## 0.9.93 (2026-09-08)

- Trace model calls to client-provided task/session IDs, including hidden-model
  requests, without recording conversation content or credentials.
- Resolve system proxy settings for each new upstream connection and quota query;
  invalidate native WebSocket reuse when the proxy endpoint changes.
- Keep loopback providers direct even when a proxy is enabled while EMP runs.
- Correlate upstream requests with the upstream gateway using an opaque request ID.
- Record structured TLS causes and WebSocket receive state on transport failures.

## 0.9.92 (2026-09-08)

- Refresh model names, visibility, and added models without restarting after
  enabling the dynamic catalog with a ChatGPT login. Codex runtime 0.153.4
  refreshes the catalog automatically about every 4.5 minutes. Restart Codex
  once when upgrading from the static catalog.
- Keep the original native catalog separate from the merged model cache so
  hidden models can be restored and renamed models do not overwrite defaults.
- Show compact quota reset countdowns with a refresh icon, updated every minute.
- Reuse the existing atomic file writer for model catalogs.

## 0.9.91 (2026-09-07)

- Fix update controls remaining visible when hidden: an up-to-date installation
  no longer shows the background-install button. Preserve hidden states while
  checking or installing updates.

## 0.9.9 (2026-09-07)

### Fixed

- Fix external subagent delegation in Codex Responses Lite, including follow-up
  tasks and tool calls. Verify Gemini 3.7 Flash and 3.8 Flash high with Codex
  runtime 0.153.4. Report encrypted tasks that cannot be forwarded explicitly.
- Preserve plaintext collaboration markers on incremental WebSocket requests.
- Preserve literal reasoning and tool markup in answers instead of rejecting
  ordinary text with a 502 error.
- Preserve Chat refusal messages in Responses output and streaming events.
- Translate Chat token usage, including cached and reasoning tokens, and retain
  usage reported at the end of a stream.
- Preserve the requested reasoning effort when model capabilities are unknown.
- Label Codex Spark quotas and let users view Codex/Spark and 5h/7d histories
  separately. Keep dense sampling points from obscuring trend lines.

### Maintenance

- Remove text-marker rejection and its rolling stream probes; protocol handling
  uses structured events instead of guessing from answer text.
- Keep runtime compatibility labels derived from one version definition and
  avoid copying ordinary text deltas in the collaboration adapter.

## 0.9.8 (2026-09-05)

### Added

- Support Astra and Codex 0.153.x. EMP supports Codex 0.149.x–0.153.x;
  version 0.153.4 is recommended.
- Check for updates from the web page and install newer stable versions in the
  background. EMP waits for active requests before restarting and restores the
  previous version if the new app fails to start. Add a GitHub shortcut.
- Keep performance history across restarts. Show recent per-model TTFT (time
  until output starts) and TPS (output tokens per second), and compare with the
  preceding sample window to make speed changes easier to see. Separate Fast
  and Standard results when the mode is known.
- Add connection diagnostics to help locate failures in EMP, the network, or the
  upstream service, without recording chat content or credentials.

### Fixed

- Detect ChatGPT on Windows and macOS more reliably, and show the correct Codex
  runtime version after updating the app and rescanning.
- Fix Side chat history reconstruction when the local history index is missing
  or the chat inherits history from its parent conversation (#8).
- Fix tool-call ID errors that prevented continuing a conversation after
  switching between external and native models (#9).
- Preserve native model context, reasoning settings, and requested Fast/Standard
  mode without incorrectly applying native routing settings to other providers.
- Correct TTFT/TPS measurements: empty events no longer count as first output,
  and reasoning tokens no longer inflate output speed. Omit unreliable speed
  values for short bursts, incomplete responses, or insufficient measurements.
- Keep 5h and 7d quota histories separate even when the service changes their
  order. Label each curve, show reset times on hover, and break lines at quota
  replenishment or sampling gaps instead of drawing misleading connections.
- Prevent old trend responses from replacing the selected account or time
  range, and retain all quota groups returned by the service.
- Prevent an error in another page section from leaving Codex integration stuck
  on “Reading status”.
- Prevent Windows background updates from hanging on an unattended system error
  dialog when the new executable cannot launch.

## 0.9.7 (2026-09-02)

- Use the operating system TLS trust store in packaged builds, including the
  macOS Keychain. Fail packaging when the frozen executable cannot activate
  that backend, preventing a DMG that turns every upstream request into a TLS
  502 while the local EMP service remains healthy.
- Verify the complete v0.9.0-v0.9.7 `.emp` migration matrix and keep a regression
  test for importing bundles that predate newer catalog presentation fields.
- Align native Responses WebSocket forwarding with the current Codex transport:
  negotiate permessage-deflate, respect the system proxy, use a 15-second
  connection timeout and one 300-second per-message idle timeout, and keep
  connection continuity for incremental `previous_response_id` turns.
- Remove EMP's 64 MiB outbound native request cutoff. Accepted long-history
  requests stay on the compressed WebSocket path instead of falling back to a
  full-history HTTP replay. Keep Codex's 64 MiB incoming message boundary.
- Remove the extra 16 MiB cumulative response ceiling and fixed event-count
  ceiling, which could terminate otherwise healthy long reasoning and tool
  streams.
- Remove the EMP-only four-generation Subscription gate and 45-second queue.
  Accepted turns now reach the upstream immediately; the provider remains the
  authority for account concurrency and 429 responses. Keep the process-wide
  adaptive listener guard for local thread and memory safety.
- Preserve explicit status codes from native WebSocket error events, so 429,
  authentication failures, and upstream 5xx responses are no longer recorded
  as a generic 502.
- Keep Codex as the sole owner of post-dispatch retries. EMP never replays a
  request that may already have reached the upstream, avoiding duplicate model
  generations and tool side effects.

## 0.9.6 (2026-09-02)

- Name the installed executable and desktop application `EMP` on Windows,
  Linux, and macOS. Keep release filenames versionless and show the running
  version beside the EMP title in the Web UI.
- Extend the tested Codex compatibility line through `0.152.x` and recommend
  `0.152.x`, based on the stable Windows `0.152.0` runtime used by Codex App
  and a successful long-running Responses WebSocket session through EMP.
- Decode masked WebSocket frames with bounded bulk byte translation instead of
  a Python per-byte loop, reducing EMP's local cost for large Codex messages.
- Reserve short-request capacity separately from long-lived Codex WebSockets,
  and grow the local listener from 64 to 256 total connections as demand rises.
  This prevents many idle task connections from exhausting the listener and
  surfacing as repeated local `502 Bad Gateway` failures.
- Start each Subscription identity with four active generations, grow gradually
  to 16 only after successful completions under queue pressure, and halve the
  current limit after an upstream 429. Queue additional turns fairly and fail a
  queue timeout before dispatch without duplicating upstream side effects.
- End a native stream that produces no substantive output within 120 seconds,
  while retaining the 300-second idle allowance after output starts. Never
  replay over HTTP once the WebSocket request may have reached the upstream;
  HTTP fallback remains limited to pre-dispatch handshake failures.
- Probe an idle upstream WebSocket with a bounded ping/pong before reusing it.
  Discard a stale channel before the next request is sent, so an unnoticed
  remote close becomes a safe reconnect/full-context retry instead of a 502.
- Keep the account quota display synchronized with EMP's background samples
  through a local-only account-state poll. Use accessible battery meters,
  animate only actual quota changes, and add nearest-point hover details to
  the quota trend chart.
- Record content-free TTFT and TPS measurements from real Responses output and
  terminal usage events. Exclude reasoning tokens from TPS, suppress TPS for
  sub-second buffered output bursts, and omit internal requests without a valid
  measurement. Aggregate recent safe logs across EMP restarts by model using
  median TTFT/TPS, and keep OpenAI Fast requests separate from standard mode.
- Add a compact health view over the same bounded, privacy-safe request log,
  including observed success, 429, 502, 503, 504, and local queue-limit rates.
  Distinguish an unavailable configured proxy, DNS resolution, TLS, network,
  timeout, and actual upstream 5xx failures instead of collapsing them into a
  generic 502. Keep the latest 512 route observations available for aggregation
  while returning only the latest 64 request details to the browser.
- Tighten the settings UI hierarchy with quieter secondary actions, compact
  spacing, restrained borders and locally embedded Phosphor action icons in
  both themes. Keep model display visible in a desktop side panel, update its
  context preview immediately, remove the unused reasoning-summary control,
  and distinguish client actions from EMP actions.
- Move Web search into Codex integration and select credentials automatically:
  prefer the current `.codex` login, then fall back to a readable imported
  Subscription account. Migrate legacy pinned account settings automatically.
- Replace raw Provider model-discovery HTTP 400/401/403 errors with a concise
  API-key or permission message.
- Automatically grow each Responses HTTP/compaction/WebSocket request's 64 MiB
  baseline allowance up to 1 GiB, subject to shared memory reservations. Release
  allowances after processing and keep expansion details in local diagnostics
  and console output. Preserve response/management limits and bounded decompression;
  report rejected requests explicitly without truncating history.
- Keep the normal Web UI focused on the current state and next action. Hide
  compatibility internals, polling policy, storage details, duplicate-account
  behavior, catalog ordering, and request-capacity policy unless an actual error
  or compatibility problem needs the user's attention.
- Bundle the OpenSSL DLLs actually loaded by the Windows build interpreter,
  preventing unrelated DLLs on PATH from breaking HTTPS and native WebSocket
  certificate loading. Check the frozen TLS runtime before packaging artifacts.
- Allow native-only catalogs to apply model visibility and display names without
  requiring an additional subscription or Provider model. Keep empty catalogs
  blocked and report native display verification as pending, not as a failed
  account or a proven runtime reload.
- Keep saved Codex client preferences separate from general Web settings saves,
  and preserve unsaved client checkboxes across search saves and rescans.
- Preserve `SYSTEMROOT` in the isolated Windows quota subprocess environment so
  quota requests can reach the service without inheriting unrelated secrets.

- Detect only editor runtimes for the host OS and CPU architecture, so a newer
  bundled Linux/WSL binary cannot hide a Windows Codex installation.
- Keep healthy clients visible when another runtime fails its version probe,
  and show compatibility or probe-failure status beside each client.
- Distinguish an unavailable or failed scan from an empty runtime inventory.

## 0.9.4 (2026-08-30)

### Shared Codex runtime compatibility

- Stop treating the persistent Codex App Server as an EMP-owned process:
  integration enable, restore, catalog refresh, and reload checks no longer
  stop, start, restart, or terminate Codex processes.
- Query the existing Unix control socket with a real WebSocket Upgrade and the
  `initialize` / `initialized` / `model/list` JSON-RPC sequence instead of
  writing JSONL into the raw `app-server proxy` byte tunnel.
- Report saved files separately from model IDs observed in the live backend;
  stale or unavailable listeners now wait for the backend owner instead of
  claiming synchronization.

## 0.9.3 (2026-08-30)

### Codex and catalog management

- Show the current `.codex` login beside imported Subscription accounts, with
  credential-free quota refresh and direct Native model visibility controls.
- Make Native the sole visibility owner when an imported account duplicates the
  current `.codex` login, while retaining quota refresh on the duplicate row.
- Apply display name, context label, and reasoning-summary policy once per
  canonical model family while retaining account and Provider source prefixes.
- Shorten the browser title and heading to `EMP`.
- Prefer the Codex-managed runtime for integration and report an
  older standalone `PATH` CLI separately.
- Sample each unique Subscription quota every five minutes and show local
  one-hour, one-day, one-week, and 15-day trends without storing credentials.
- Scale quota charts to the observed range so small changes remain readable.
- Keep imported account route prefixes stable while allowing a separate
  display label, including emoji, in the model catalog.
- Classify imported-account quota refresh failures without replacing a stored
  credential after an unsuccessful refresh, and use the selected managed Codex
  runtime for quota requests.
- Treat a disconnected same-route Native WebSocket as lost transport continuity
  so Codex automatically retries the full request instead of upstream rejecting
  an old `previous_response_id` on a new connection.

### Packaging

- Remove the opaque navy tile from the master application icon so generated
  Windows, macOS, and Linux icons retain a transparent background.

## 0.9.2 (2026-08-30)

### Model catalog

- Honor current-login model visibility by omitting user-hidden Native picker
  entries while preserving internal hidden service models such as Codex Auto
  Review.

### Packaging

- Keep the complete checksum-verified build matrix in CI while exposing only
  five normal installation downloads on GitHub Releases.

## 0.9.1 (2026-08-30)

### Codex compatibility

- Publish the supported Codex CLI range (`0.149.x`–`0.151.x`) and recommended
  release line in the Web UI and documentation without exposing source hashes.
- Detect newer, older, unavailable, and unrecognized Codex installations with
  one bounded compatibility probe outside the routing path.
- Keep quota refreshes on the official Codex App Server path while forwarding
  Codex-specific CA settings, exporting Windows trust roots when needed, and
  accepting the Codex 0.151 rate-limit response shapes.
- Passively verify the active EMP catalog after Codex restarts so stale runtime
  failures recover without stopping Codex or asking the user to reapply models.

## 0.9.0 (2026-08-29)

### Packaging

- Add reproducible native PyInstaller builds for Windows x64, Linux x64,
  macOS Intel, and macOS Apple Silicon.
- Produce direct executables, ZIP/tar archives, Linux `.deb`, macOS `.dmg`, and
  SHA-256 sidecars from one cross-platform packaging script.
- Smoke-test each packaged service on an isolated loopback configuration before
  uploading the artifact.
- Optionally collect all four native builds into a checksum-verified GitHub
  Draft Pre-release for manual review and publication.
- Add original EMP artwork and native Windows, macOS, and Linux application
  icons.
- Make packaged no-argument launch open the authenticated Web UI in a visible,
  foreground terminal that can be stopped with `Ctrl+C`.
- Add a macOS application bundle inside each DMG and a Linux desktop menu entry
  inside the Debian package.

### Maintenance architecture

- Centralized immutable route resolution and request dispatch across HTTP and
  Responses WebSocket entry points.
- Isolated Native Responses, portable Responses, Chat Completions, and
  Anthropic projection behind protocol adapters.
- Unified content-free upstream failure classification and bounded stream
  lifecycle handling without changing fallback policy.
- Split credential-free management and Codex integration projections out of
  the runtime request path.
- Preserved Codex-owned history, transport-only `previous_response_id`, Native
  compaction, final-payload Context Guard authority, and fail-closed external
  history reconstruction.

### Verification

- Passed focused routing, protocol, history, context, stream, replay, and
  runtime integration checks plus Python compilation and whitespace validation.
- Live-validated first-send Native to External, External to External, and
  External to Native transitions with repeated compaction, tools, and image
  continuity on the current host.

## 0.8.1 (2026-08-27)

### Product

- Added Codex 0.150 named standalone tool-output support. Responses keeps the
  native item shape, while Chat Completions and Anthropic receive explicit
  visible context without fabricated call IDs.
- Unified Native destination classification so forwarded Native routes keep
  Codex-owned opaque history and never invoke EMP destination compaction.
- Included the resolved upstream model in Provider replay identity, preventing
  opaque tool metadata from crossing a model remap.
- Bounded aggregate SSE events and pre-output retry buffers, and made temporary
  context-failure calibration expire or clear after contradictory success.
- Made Provider-key saves and `.emp` account imports transactional, restoring
  prior encrypted credentials if the surrounding configuration update fails.

### Verification

- Passed Python compilation, whitespace validation, and 336 focused regression
  tests for the affected continuity, protocol, context, stream, replay, and
  credential boundaries.
- Live-validated Codex 0.150.1 Native opaque compaction to External, portable
  External compaction to another External model, External to Native, image and
  tool continuity, and `codex resume` on the current host.

## 0.8.0 (2026-08-26)

### Product

- Separated WebSocket transport continuity, Codex-owned history
  materialization, and destination context budgeting into independent
  boundaries.
- Made an unavailable `previous_response_id` return Codex's standard retry
  event without reading local history, allowing Codex to resend the same turn
  as a full logical request.
- Limited rollout reconstruction to full external-destination requests that
  contain unreadable native opaque compaction state. Native destinations and
  portable EMP checkpoints remain reader-free.
- Implemented Codex 0.149 remote-compaction-v2 reconstruction from the latest
  `replacement_history` plus the successful tail, with fail-closed handling of
  unresolved opaque state.
- Made Context Guard the only final destination-payload budget decision. An
  oversized payload is compacted for that destination, re-projected, and
  checked once more before sending.
- Preserved current request window identity across long-lived WebSockets after
  native compaction while keeping thread identity conflicts strict.
- Kept standalone web search on Codex's Subscription-backed tool path so an
  external model can search without receiving Provider or Subscription
  credentials.
- Treated client-cancelled HTTP streams as normal disconnects: EMP now closes
  the upstream iterator without logging an internal 500 or writing a second
  response to an already closed socket.

### Verification

- Passed the complete offline suite for the P0 change set. After the final
  isolated WebSocket window-identity correction, its focused continuity,
  history, context, loopback, compilation, and whitespace checks also passed.
- Live-validated first-send Native -> External, External -> External, and
  External -> Native transitions after compaction, including tools, image
  input, standalone search, compressed large requests, later WebSocket turns,
  and native resume on Codex 0.149.
- Confirmed EMP does not write Codex SQLite or rollout files and does not put
  conversation content in its diagnostic journal.

## 0.7.6 (2026-08-25)

- Added destination-model hierarchical compaction, stricter stream terminal
  handling, and Subscription-backed standalone search for external models.
- Kept derived checkpoints memory-only and diagnostics content-free while
  preserving Codex-owned threads and resume state.

## 0.7.5 (2026-08-24)

- Replaced the legacy continuity layer with read-only Codex App Server,
  SQLite-locator, and rollout history adapters.
- Reconstructed visible history only for external handoffs across an opaque
  native compaction boundary; native routing retained Codex's own compaction
  and retry behavior.
- Simplified model presentation and management controls without introducing an
  EMP-owned history database.

## 0.6.0 (2026-08-23)

### Product

- Unified native-login, imported-subscription, and external Provider models in
  one stable catalog with compact context labels, deterministic grouping, and
  provider-qualified external slugs across the CLI, TUI, and desktop app.
- Added capability-aware Responses dialect projection for text, image,
  reasoning, structured tools, and external Codex child workers without making
  EMP the owner of tasks, permissions, or persisted history.
- Made external compaction EMP-owned and portable, while rejecting unknown or
  unexpected Provider-owned opaque state instead of silently dropping history.
- Added encrypted, content-free native compaction bindings and exact-source
  handoff so model switches among the current login, imported subscriptions,
  and external Providers can preserve compacted task context without storing a
  second conversation history.
- Added protocol-specific recoverable handoff failures: structured HTTP 409,
  one terminal SSE failure, and one request-scoped WebSocket failure that leaves
  the connection usable for the next request.
- Preserved native Codex Zstandard request compression and added one bounded
  pre-header retry using identical encoded bytes, while leaving external routes
  uncompressed unless explicitly supported.
- Added request-local compression diagnostics and bounded concurrency evidence
  without recording prompts, responses, tool payloads, opaque state, headers,
  endpoints, account IDs, or credentials.
- Made translated Chat and Anthropic streams require formal terminal markers,
  reject unknown finish states, preserve parallel tool turns, and keep
  fragmented or sparse tool calls type- and index-stable.
- Bound native upstream WebSockets by absolute time and cumulative bytes, made
  authentication/rate-limit failures terminal, and measured first-event latency
  from the actual upstream attempt rather than local preparation.
- Rejected symlinked credential-key paths and made Web UI account/model edits
  commit atomically so a failed save cannot corrupt browser-side state.

### Verification

- Passed the focused v0.6 modules and the bounded complete suite with 813 tests;
  the two existing opt-in live Provider/Codex checks remained skipped.
- Proved six simultaneous mixed native/external, streaming/non-streaming
  requests overlap without slot rejection or cross-request diagnostic state,
  including exact native zstd round-trip equality.
- Passed compile, lock consistency, whitespace, ignored-local-state, and
  secret/private-data checks using offline fixtures and temporary loopback
  servers only.

## 0.5.0 (2026-08-22)

### Product

- Replaced profile-based startup with an explicit, leased default-Codex
  integration that preserves native session identity and ordinary `codex`,
  `codex resume`, `/model`, and Desktop App configuration behavior.
- Added offline `doctor` and `restore` commands, atomic compare-and-restore,
  conflict preservation, and stale-lease recovery after an interrupted EMP
  process.
- Added capability records with source, confidence, timestamps, and
  endpoint/model/protocol/deployment identity; unsupported values remain
  `unknown`.
- Made `auto` protocol reuse identity-safe and limited fallback to explicit
  protocol rejection statuses instead of authentication, WAF, rate-limit,
  timeout, or server failures.
- Added a bounded in-memory diagnostics ring and compact Web status view without
  retaining prompts, responses, tool payloads, credentials, raw endpoints, or
  upstream HTML bodies.
- Added Context Guard preflight checks over translated upstream payloads,
  connection-local bounded WebSocket replay state, and numeric context
  calibration from terminal success and explicit context-length failures.
- Added persisted model input modalities from Provider discovery, conservative
  text-only fallback, Codex text/image catalog projection, and image-preserving
  Responses and Chat Completions routing.
- Added portable stop-only Codex runtime synchronization. Initial enable and
  restore each use one confirmation to write the target, request the supported
  Remote Control graceful stop, and verify the complete paginated `model/list`
  if an external owner brings Codex back. EMP never starts or restarts Codex.
- Added a targeted cross-platform residual-host scan after both successful
  lifecycle statuses and for the documented unmanaged App Server error. It uses
  lazy psutil inspection, canonical official Node-shim resolution, exact
  same-user and active-integration-`CODEX_HOME` identity revalidation, and
  strict parsing of supported root options before the semantic host command.
  Environment inspection occurs only after a supported host role is proved and
  reads only `CODEX_HOME`. It uses graceful termination only, bounded waits,
  and strict exclusions for Codex clients, lookalikes, ambiguous argv, other
  homes, and helper commands; no process details leave the local control boundary.
- Bounded Codex control-command memory during execution by directing stdout and
  stderr to temporary file sinks and reading only the documented caps after
  exit; timeout, no-shell, return-code, and JSON parsing behavior remain intact.
- Persisted bounded runtime recovery phases while treating prior loaded states
  as stale after EMP restarts. Offline `doctor` and `restore` never probe Codex
  or claim a live catalog verification.
- Added a searchable model-discovery picker with selected/total counts and
  bulk select/clear actions for the current filter. Existing imports remain
  selected while newly discovered models start unselected.
- Kept Codex as the sole thread/history owner: EMP never silently trims,
  compacts, switches models, or retries a known over-limit request.
- Routed known unprefixed native models through the current validated Codex
  login without requiring a synthetic forward Provider.
- Kept successful enable/restore configuration transactions out of the
  `Conflict` state when only the independent runtime catalog verification
  warns, and exposed the warning separately as an action-required runtime state.
- Added compact usable-context suffixes to generated model display names, using
  native effective-window percentages and conservative unknown handling; the
  same context is appended to descriptions for slug-oriented TUI pickers.
- Kept hidden native service models out of user model pickers while allowing
  internal Codex requests such as auto-review to route through the current login.
- Clarified Provider discovery bulk actions with dynamic `Select all` / `Select
  none` labels that explicitly scope themselves to search results while filtering.
- Made an imported account that matches the current Codex login act as the
  visibility controller for unprefixed native models while retaining the
  account row and suppressing only its redundant prefixed aliases.

### Verification

- Covered the v0.5 implementation with offline unit and loopback integration
  tests. Cross-platform packaging and runtime checks remain future hardening.
- Added 11 focused multimodal regressions covering discovery, persistence,
  catalog refresh, manual overrides, URL/data-URL conversion, and Responses
  passthrough.
- Live-validated unprefixed current-login routing, a prefixed imported
  subscription, the combined `/model` catalog, native resume visibility,
  Desktop App model selection, an external Provider, and image input on Codex
  0.149.0 running on the current Linux host.

## 0.4.0 (Unreleased)

### Product

- Reused Codex's native `openai` session identity while routing the EMP profile
  through `openai_base_url`, so native resume commands include default history.
- Added the native profile resume command to generated integration output.
- Added native Responses WebSocket handling and bounded zstd/gzip/deflate
  request decoding without disabling Codex transport features.
- Preserved Codex remote compaction v1/v2, including translated Chat
  Completions and Anthropic providers.
- Accepted valid subscription SSE streams when an upstream proxy omits the
  `Content-Type` response header.
- Kept native hidden models such as Codex Auto Review out of subscription
  aliases, and added per-account model visibility controls.
- Added one-click hide/show for every imported model under a Provider.
- Separated the 30-second upstream connection timeout from the 180-second
  response deadline and retried one transient connection failure, preventing
  slow Gemini responses from being cut off as internal errors.
- Made custom Provider `auto` mode negotiate Responses first, fall back only on
  explicit protocol rejection, and persist the working protocol instead of
  silently forcing Chat Completions during model discovery.
- Converted translated streaming failures into terminal `response.failed`
  events with the upstream HTTP status, so Codex displays the real failure
  instead of only reporting a missing terminal event.
- Kept Codex client telemetry out of external API-key Responses requests while
  preserving native subscription passthrough, and replaced raw upstream HTML
  error pages with bounded gateway/WAF diagnostics.

## 0.3.0 (Unreleased)

### Product

- Added the ChatGPT Subscription forward Provider for Codex subscription traffic.
- Added structured tool-call and history support across Responses and Chat
  protocols.
- Added streaming handling for non-SSE responses, empty streams, and upstream
  errors.
- Added interception for textual `<think>` and `<tool_call>` leakage.

### Verification

- Added deterministic CLI contract coverage for JSONL, profiles, resume/restart,
  and failure semantics.
- Validated real Luna and Sol subscription canaries, explicit-thread resume,
  controlled cancellation/recovery, and the LIVE-02/LIVE-03 tool oracles.
- Added the 401/404/429/500 and malformed-stream fault matrix plus a bounded
  deterministic soak.

## 0.2.0 (Unreleased)

- Added encrypted `.emp` migration bundles for moving configuration, model
  routes, Provider keys, and Codex subscription credentials between machines.
- Imported credentials are re-encrypted with the destination machine's local
  master key; the migration bundle never contains the local master key.
- Fixed Web UI status notifications and batch quota refresh across multiple
  accounts; repeated refreshes of the same account remain rate-limited.

## 0.1.0

- Added local Web UI management for encrypted Codex subscription accounts,
  API providers, model discovery, routing, and quota snapshots.
- Added Codex profile generation with one EMP model catalog and isolated EMP
  sessions.
- Added Responses, Chat Completions, and Anthropic Messages upstream routing.
- Added proxy environment detection and a real Codex CLI demo model test.
- Published as a Linux-validated MVP; ChatGPT App and other platforms remain
  manual acceptance items.
